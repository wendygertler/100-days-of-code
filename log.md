# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp, including Bootstrap.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I complete a section and learn something new and actually understand what I'm doing.

**Link(s) to work**

2. [Apply the Default Bootstrap Button Style](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/apply-the-default-bootstrap-button-style)
