# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp, including Bootstrap.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I complete a section and learn something new and actually understand what I'm doing.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I created a David Bowie Tribute Page, using Bootstrap, on CodePen as my first project in Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts** It's been awhile since I've worked with Bootstrap; so, I really enjoyed this project. I'm going to create more sites using Bootstrap so I can practice and learn more advanced techniques.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I started working on project 2 on FreeCodeCamp, Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage.

**Thoughts** I decided not to use Bootstrap for this project, since I used it for the last one. I enjoy writing CSS and watching my website come to life in the browser.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I had to update my own website to add a Shopify referral link. I continued to work on project 2 on FreeCodeCamp, Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage.

**Thoughts** I forget things when I don't code for awhile, so I had to look things up; but, that's good because I'm constantly learning all over again.

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on Free Code Camps's project Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage.
